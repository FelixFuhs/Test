Step-by-Step Plan for Gym Workout Tracking Website

Set Up the Project Environment

Git Repository: Set up a repository on GitHub to manage version control.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js for a dynamic interface, using tools like React Router for navigation.

Backend: Node.js with Express for handling API requests.

Database: MongoDB, as it’s flexible for storing workout data, or PostgreSQL if you prefer a relational approach.

Folder Structure: Establish a consistent folder structure (e.g., frontend, backend, database).

Basic Website Layout and Routing

Homepage: Create a landing page with navigation buttons like "Add Exercise," "View Workouts," and "Progress."

Routing Setup: Use React Router to handle client-side routing for different views like workout logs, exercise management, and progress.

Exercise Management

Add Exercise Form: Create a form for users to add exercises, specifying details like name, muscles worked, and equipment needed.

Exercise Page:

Exercise Information: Show exercise name, target muscles, estimated 1RM (calculated with Epley’s formula).

Track 1RM Evolution: Create a graph showing how the estimated 1RM evolves over time.

Volume Tracking: Track total volume lifted per exercise to see progress over time.

Workout Planning and Logging

Workout Planner:

Allow users to create a custom workout for each day by selecting pre-defined exercises.

Include options to log details like sets, reps, weight, and RIR for each exercise.

Workout Logger:

Add input fields to log multiple sets for each exercise, with buttons like "Add Set".

Progress Charts:

Implement data visualization for metrics like total volume, reps, and weight progress.

User Authentication

Accounts: Allow users to create accounts to securely store their workout data.

Multiple Users: Add functionality for multiple users to have separate workout histories.

Data Visualization and Analytics

Progress Dashboard: Create an overview dashboard for users, displaying their training stats.

Charts: Use Chart.js to add graphs for:

Total volume lifted per workout.

Estimated 1RM progression.

Workout streak.

Feature Enhancements and Styling

Styling: Use TailwindCSS or Bootstrap to style the pages, making them clean and easy to use.

Advanced Features:

Implement a calendar to plan and visualize workouts over a week or month.

Allow users to compare exercises and see trends.

Create a REST API to enable easier interaction between frontend and backend.

Testing and Deployment

Testing: Use tools like Jest for unit testing of components and backend routes.

Deployment:

Backend: Deploy using Heroku or AWS.

Frontend: Deploy using Netlify or Vercel.

Suggested Tech Stack and Tools

Frontend: React.js, React Router, Chart.js for charts, TailwindCSS/Bootstrap for styling.

Backend: Node.js with Express, JWT for authentication.

Database: MongoDB (or PostgreSQL if a relational database is preferred).

Hosting: Netlify/Vercel for frontend, Heroku for backend.
