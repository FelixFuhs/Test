# Gym Training App: Comprehensive Requirements & Scientific Framework

## 1. Core Vision and Purpose

The app aims to create a scientifically-sound, evidence-based platform for strength training that accomplishes three key goals:

1. **Exercise Management**: Allow users to build a personalized exercise library with precise muscle targeting information
2. **Workout Planning**: Enable creation of structured workout templates with volume optimization based on scientific literature
3. **Training Logging**: Provide intelligent workout execution with progressive overload tracking and performance metrics

The app should integrate exercise science principles throughout, making research-based training approaches accessible to all users.

## 2. Scientific Principles to Incorporate

### 2.1 Volume Landmarks
* Implement **Minimum Effective Volume (MEV)**, **Maximum Adaptive Volume (MAV)**, and **Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV)** concepts (Israetel et al., 2019)
* Default recommendations per muscle group:
  * Chest: MEV 8 sets, MAV 12-16 sets, MRV 20 sets weekly
  * Back: MEV 10 sets, MAV 14-22 sets, MRV 25 sets weekly
  * Shoulders: MEV 8 sets, MAV 16-22 sets, MRV 26 sets weekly
  * Biceps: MEV 8 sets, MAV 14-20 sets, MRV 26 sets weekly
  * Triceps: MEV 6 sets, MAV 10-14 sets, MRV 18 sets weekly
  * Quads: MEV 8 sets, MAV 12-18 sets, MRV 22 sets weekly
  * Hamstrings: MEV 6 sets, MAV 10-16 sets, MRV 20 sets weekly
  * Glutes: MEV 4 sets, MAV 8-12 sets, MRV 16 sets weekly
  * Calves: MEV 6 sets, MAV 12-16 sets, MRV 20 sets weekly
  * Abs: MEV 0 sets, MAV 16-20 sets, MRV 25 sets weekly

### 2.2 Effective Reps
* Track **Reps In Reserve (RIR)** for each set (Zourdos et al., 2016)
* Implement the concept of "effective reps" – last 5 reps before failure provide most growth stimulus
* Recommendation: Most sets should be performed at 1-3 RIR for optimal balance of stimulus and fatigue

### 2.3 Progressive Overload
* Implement intelligent weight progression algorithms based on rep/RIR performance
* If target reps achieved at target RIR: increase weight by 2.5-5% next session
* If exceeded target reps: increase weight by 5-10% next session
* If missed target reps: maintain or decrease weight by 5% next session

### 2.4 Exercise Selection & Classification
* Categorize exercises by:
  * **Mechanical tension potential**: high, medium, low
  * **Resistance profile**: consistent tension, ascending, descending, bell-shaped
  * **Stability requirements**: stable, moderate, unstable
  * **Range of motion**: partial, standard, extended
  * **Primary/secondary muscle involvement**: percentage contribution estimates

### 2.5 Frequency & Recovery
* Support training frequencies from 1-6x per muscle group weekly
* Implement recovery tracking based on:
  * Time since last training of muscle group (minimum 48hr recovery recommendation)
  * Volume accumulation (higher volumes require more recovery time)
  * Intensity used (higher intensity requires more recovery time)

### 2.6 Periodization
* Support creation of mesocycles (4-8 week training blocks)
* Enable volume progression within mesocycles:
  * Week 1-2: Slightly below MAV
  * Week 3-4: At MAV
  * Week 5-6: Approaching MRV
  * Week 7: Deload (50-60% of normal volume)

## 3. Module-Specific Requirements
